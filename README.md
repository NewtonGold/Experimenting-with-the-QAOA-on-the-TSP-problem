#  Experimenting with the QAOA on the TSP problem
 
Welcome to the Experimenting with the QAOA on the TSP problem repository! This repository showcases my Master's Project, where I delved into the realm of quantum computing, focusing on solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Through a fusion of rigorous research and creative thinking, I have developed methods leveraging the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to address the challenges posed by the TSP.

## Overview
Throughout this project, I delved deep into quantum computing, specifically exploring the potential of quantum algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem. By applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), I aimed to find efficient solutions that could outperform classical algorithms.

### Methods
To achieve this, I transformed the TSP into the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model using various methods. These methods were carefully researched and implemented to ensure compatibility with quantum computing paradigms. The project repository contains the code and documentation detailing these transformations.

### Testing
I thoroughly tested the developed models using quantum simulators to validate their functionality and performance. Simulations provided insights into the quantum feasibility of the proposed solutions and allowed for iterative improvements.

### Results
The project's highlight was the successful execution of a real TSP instance on one of IBM's Quantum Computers. This practical implementation served as a proof of concept, showcasing the potential of quantum computing to tackle complex optimization problems like the TSP.
